            <p style="text-align: left;">Tests show that <b>plain text emails</b> are always the best performing emails.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">It makes your readers feel as if you actually took the time to write out a full email to them vs. pretty HTML emails that are perceived as spam most times.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Generally, a plain text email should not exceed a few hundred words, and reading time should be under a minute.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">If you can accomplish all that, you should be able to write an awesome plain text email!</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Best of Luck!</b></p>
